a device that can quickly give you the recipes and links to buy or make the food you love. The first thing to do is to access the ib watson conversation interface. Then create the following entities: @food, @buy, @make, @greet. Which under each you need to create values. For greet, make it greet you with a formal phrase like 'Hi, how can I help you today?'
